  <description>A massive content expansion focused on enhancing the late-game experience. It introduces new offensive measures against mechanoids, ways to produce previously uncraftable recipes, and brings your colony one step closer to becoming a glitterworld paradise.\n\nYou can expect original gameplay mechanics, a brand-new production chain, tons of new items, and more!\n\nThe mod is designed to fit seamlessly with the base game, and I’ve done my best to balance it accordingly.\n\nAs always, all suggestions about balance and content are very welcome. I can’t promise to implement them all, but I love reading your creative ideas.\n\nIf you’re familiar with my previous mod – Glitterworld Uprising – this work will feel very familiar, but this is like the version 2000. It’s been redesigned, rebalanced, redrawn, rewritten, repolished and expanded with care.</description>
